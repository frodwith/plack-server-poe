=head1 NAME

POE::Component::Server::PSGI

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PSGI Server implementation for POE.

=head1 NOTE

We've switched over to using nperez's excellent L<POEx::Role::PSGIServer>,
since it's essentially a (much better) refactor of this module's original
code.  Use this if you just want a default implementation of his role with no
modifications.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use POE::Component::Server::PSGI;

    my $server = POE::Component::Server::PSGI->new(
        host => $host,
        port => $port,
    );
    $server->run($app);

=head1 INTERFACE

See Plack::Server.
